# [GPLikelihoods.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGaussianProcesses/GPLikelihoods.jl/)

GPLikelihoods aims at facilitating the use of latent models with non-conjugate likelihoods.
The goal is to represent different models such as classification ``y \sim \textrm{Bernoulli}(g(f(x))))`` or event counting ${y \sim \textrm{Poisson}(g(f(x)))}$ given an adapted transformation $g$.
