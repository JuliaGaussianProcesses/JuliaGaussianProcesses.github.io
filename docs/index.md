# Julia Gaussian Processes

This is the website to host the general documentation for the packages [KernelFunctions.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGaussianProcesses/KernelFunctions.jl), [AbstractGPs.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGaussianProcesses/AbstractGPs.jl), [GPLikelihoods.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGaussianProcesses/GPLikelihoods.jl) and more to come!

!!! info
    Note that this website is still a work in progress and a lot of things are missing/buggy, for now check out the docs of each package, [submit an issue](https://github.com/JuliaGaussianProcesses/JuliaGaussianProcesses.github.io/issues/new) or don't hesitate to participate by [creating a pull request](https://github.com/JuliaGaussianProcesses/JuliaGaussianProcesses.github.io/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc)

You will find in this website a collection of [tutorials](tutorials) combining one or more packages from the JuliaGPs ecosystem for typical machine learning or statistics problems}

For each of the packages we also provide resources and documentation to get a better understanding of the tools and the topics you can access them here:

- [AbstractGPs.jl](abstractgps)
- [GPLikelihoods.jl](gplikelihoods)
- [KernelFunctions.jl](kernelfunctions)

We also recommend to check out pre-existing Gaussian Process package which may do what you want already.
We list here the most known packages but don't hesitate to add yours via a PR!

- [AugmentedGaussianProcesses.jl](https://github.com/theogf/AugmentedGaussianProcesses.jl) : Focused on non-conjugate Gaussian Processes, scalability and the use of Variational Inference.
- [GaussianProcesses.jl](https://github.com/STOR-i/GaussianProcesses.jl) : General tool-box for GPs.
- [Stheno.jl](https://github.com/willtebbutt/Stheno.jl) : Package with a focus on probabilistic programming.
