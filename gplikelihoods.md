\lead{
GPLikelihoods aims at facilitating the use of latent models with non-conjugate likelihoods.
The goal is to represent different models such as classification $y \sim \textrm{Bernoulli}(g(f(x))))$ or event counting ${y \sim \textrm{Poisson}(g(f(x)))}$ given an adapted transformation $g$.

**Note that this package is still a WIP**
It has not been released as a package yet, and its name may still change.
